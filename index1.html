<h1>Books that were important to me as I was growing up</h1>

    <div class="main">
<p>I was attracted to fantasy novels as a child, though the Narnia novels never crossed my path. I would have loved those! I did read a book called Seven League Boots, that is, until  accidently dropped it in a creek. I did not get to finish that book. I also loved a set of books my mom bought for me that included many of the Disney stories from movies and TV. I identified strongly with the <i>Encyclopedia Brown</i> detective books. At that time, there weren't many strong girl characters for a young girl to connect with, so I went with what was available.
