<h1>Why are books important?</h1>
    </div>
    <div>
<p>Books help us move beyond ourselves, transport us, teach us, challenge us, and more. They can inspire us and change us. Books can help us understand ourselves and the world. Like a good friend, they can help us through difficulties all of us encounter in life.</p>

        <p>Pride and Prejudice</p>
        <p>I first found this novel as a seventeen-year-old girl wandering around a discount mall. It sounded familiar, but I didn't know anything about it really. I read it and quickly found out I was lucky it was a student edition with annotations for hard words since I didn't know many of the favored terms of the Georgians. I definitely didn't understand the social or historical context. Like many first-time readers, I responded to the light-hearted Jane and her romantic endeavors.I liked that the heroine, because of her pure heart, won the whole marriage game, with a a handsome, kind, and super rich husband. As I grew older, I began to understand the clever social commentary Jane Austen added seamlessly to her book. I keep coming back to the deceptively simple story because it is easy and has a happy ending. Good is rewarded and bad is punished. I have enjoyed more complex takes on the time period, especially Longbourn, a novel by Jo Baker based on <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. It features the perspectives and lives of the servants who move nearly without personality in the original novel. Still, I return to the classic novel again and again, for the fun it always offers.</p>
