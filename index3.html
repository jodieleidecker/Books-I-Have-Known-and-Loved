<p>Octavia Butler's novels</p>
        <p>I also randomly encountered Octavia Butler at the public library in the late 1990's. Butler was very prolific in the 1970's and was a really unique science fiction writer as a woman and African-American writing in that genre in that time period. The first book I read was <i>Parable of the Talents</i>. I couldn't put the book down. Who was this woman who envisioned this new religion in the bleak new world of the near future? I quickly found the sequel. Then I tried to find everything by her that I could. Probably one of the most underestimated books by an American writer is her <i>Kindred</i>. This story, a slave narrative, though written and partially set in the 1970's, is as fresh as any novel today. The timeless themes of freedom, family, and what we owe to each other, especially with the burden of our history, never fails to move me.</p>
